# AdventOfCode_2022
Advent of code 2022 solutions in plain C, using only 4 libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, math.h and string.h) 

This was my first attempt ever at AoC. I ran out of time to do more, but I might add more solutions during 2023.  
I did not include my input files, as they are proprietary to AdventOfCode.  
You can try out the solutions, by getting your own inputfiles [here](https://adventofcode.com/).
